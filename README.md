node-red-contrib-nexmo (beta)
===========================

<a href="http://nodered.org" target="_new">Node-RED</a> nodes for Nexmo APIs

## Features

- [Voice API](https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/overview) - Make and receive calls, use text to speech, recording, and DTMF input, forward calls to other destinations
- [SMS](https://developer.nexmo.com/messaging/sms/overview) - Send and receive SMS globally
- [Verify](https://developer.nexmo.com/verify/overview) - Verify a phone number with SMS and voice fallback
- [Number Insight](https://developer.nexmo.com/number-insight/overview) - Get details and formatting of phone numbers

## Account Setup
The first time you use a node you will need to create Nexmo authentication parameters.
The SMS, Insight and Verify Nodes simply use your Nexmo API key and secret.

The voice API uses a concept of [Applications](https://developer.nexmo.com/concepts/guides/applications) that are authenticated with JWTs generated by a private key. This is a little more complex to setup but we've tried to make it as easy as possible in node-red.
